# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

## Quick Start

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/main/scripts/install | bash
```

Then add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
source $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh
```

See [docs/cli/install.md](./docs/cli/install.md) for installation options and troubleshooting.

### Manual Install

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize.git ~/.agentize

# Run setup
cd ~/.agentize
make setup
```

Then add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
source $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh
```

### Initialize a New Project

Once installed, create AI-powered SDK projects:

```bash
lol apply --init --name your_project_name --lang c --path /path/to/your/project
```

This creates an initial SDK structure in the specified project path. Use `lol --help` to see all available options.

## Core Philosophy

1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.
   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.
2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/).
   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.
   - This is something like C-style declaration and implementation separation.
     - `/commands` are declarations and interfaces for users to invoke skills.
     - `/skills` are implementations of the skills.
3. Bootstrapping via self-improvement: We use `.claude/` as our canonical rules
   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.
   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.
   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally
     integrate them together.

### Workflow:

See our detailed workflow diagrams:

- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning
- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/feat/core/issue-to-impl.md) - Complete development cycle

**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.

## Cross-Project Shell Functions

Agentize provides shell functions that work from any directory:
- `wt` - Manage worktrees in bare git repositories (spawn, list, remove, prune, purge)
- `lol` - Initialize and update SDK projects (apply --init, apply --update)

For persistence, add `source /path/to/agentize/setup.sh` to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).


General-purpose git worktree helper for **bare repositories**:

```bash
wt init                  # Initialize worktree environment (run once per bare repo)
wt goto main             # Change directory to main worktree
wt goto 42               # Change directory to issue-42 worktree
wt spawn 42              # Create issue-42 branch and worktree
wt list                  # List all worktrees
wt remove 42             # Remove worktree for issue #42
wt prune                 # Clean up stale worktree metadata
wt purge                 # Remove worktrees for closed GitHub issues
wt help                  # Display help information
```

**Bare repository requirement:** `wt` works with bare git repositories. Worktrees are created under `<bare-repo>/trees/`. See `docs/cli/wt.md` for migration guide.

### SDK Project Management (`lol`)

Ergonomic commands for initializing and updating SDK projects:

**Initialize a new project:**

```bash
lol apply --init --name my-project --lang python --path /path/to/project
```

**Update an existing project:**

From project root or any subdirectory:
```bash
lol apply --update
```

Or specify explicit path:
```bash
lol apply --update --path /path/to/project
```

The `apply --update` command finds the nearest `.claude/` directory by traversing parent directories, making it convenient to use from anywhere within your project.

**Available options:**
- `--init` - Initialize a new SDK project (requires `--name` and `--lang`)
- `--update` - Update an existing SDK project
- `--name <name>` - Project name (required for `--init`)
- `--lang <lang>` - Programming language: c, cxx, python (required for `--init`)
- `--path <path>` - Project path (optional, defaults to current directory)
- `--source <path>` - Source code path relative to project root (optional)

Use `lol --help` for complete documentation.

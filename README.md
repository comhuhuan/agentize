# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

## Quick Start

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/main/scripts/install | bash
```

Then add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
source $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh
```

See [docs/cli/install.md](./docs/cli/install.md) for installation options and troubleshooting.

**Upgrade:** Run `lol upgrade` to pull the latest changes.

### Manual Install

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize.git ~/.agentize

# Run setup
cd ~/.agentize
make setup
```

Then add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
source $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh
```
## Core Philosophy

1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.
   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.
2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/).
   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.
   - This is something like C-style declaration and implementation separation.
     - `/commands` are declarations and interfaces for users to invoke skills.
     - `/skills` are implementations of the skills.
3. Bootstrapping via self-improvement: We use `.claude/` as our canonical rules
   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.
   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.
   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally
     integrate them together.

### Workflow:

See our detailed workflow diagrams:

- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning
- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/feat/core/issue-to-impl.md) - Complete development cycle

**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.

## Tutorials

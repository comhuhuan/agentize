# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize.git
```
2. Set up the shell functions:

   **Option A: Generate local setup script (recommended for development)**
   ```bash
   make env-script
   source setup.sh
   ```
   This creates a `setup.sh` with the hardcoded repo path. Add `source /path/to/agentize/setup.sh` to your shell RC file for persistence.

   **Option B: Manual setup**
   Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export AGENTIZE_HOME="/path/to/agentize"
   source "$AGENTIZE_HOME/scripts/wt-functions.sh"
   source "$AGENTIZE_HOME/scripts/agentize-functions.sh"
   ```

3. Initialize a new project:
```bash
agentize init --name your_project_name --lang c --path /path/to/your/project
```

This creates an initial SDK structure in the specified project path. For more details, see the [usage document](./docs/OPTIONS.md).

## Core Phylosophy

1. Plan first, code later: Use AI to generate a detailed plan before writing any code.
   - Plan is put on Github Issues for tracking.
2. Build [skills](https://agentskills.io/).
   - Skills are modular reusable, formal, and lightweighted flow definitions.
   - This is something like C-style declaration and implementation separation.
     - `/commands` are declarations and interfaces for users to invoke skills.
     - `/skills` are implementations of the skills.
3. Bootstrapping via self-improvement: We use `.claude/` as our canonical rules
   directory. We use these rules to develop these rules further.
   - Top-down design: Start with a high-level view of the development flow.
   - Bottom-up implementation: Implement each aspect of the flow from bottom, and finally
     integrate them together.

### Workflow:

See our detailed workflow diagrams:

- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/workflows/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning
- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/workflows/issue-to-implementation.md) - Complete development cycle

**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.

## Cross-Project Shell Functions

Agentize provides a `wt` shell function for managing worktrees from any directory. This enables `wt spawn 42` to work from any git repository, always creating worktrees in the correct location.

### Setup

Add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export AGENTIZE_HOME="/path/to/agentize"
source "$AGENTIZE_HOME/scripts/wt-functions.sh"
```

Or use `make env-script` to generate a local `setup.sh` (gitignored) with hardcoded paths:

```bash
make env-script
source setup.sh
```

### Usage

From any directory:

```bash
wt spawn 42              # Create worktree for issue #42
wt list                  # List all worktrees
wt remove 42             # Remove worktree for issue #42
wt prune                 # Clean up stale worktree metadata
```

The `wt` function ensures worktrees are always created under `$AGENTIZE_HOME/trees/`, regardless of your current directory.

### Requirements

- `AGENTIZE_HOME` environment variable must point to the agentize repository
- The function will fail with a clear error if `AGENTIZE_HOME` is missing or invalid

## Agentize CLI Wrapper

For convenience, Agentize provides ergonomic `agentize init` and `agentize update` commands as alternatives to the verbose `make agentize` interface. The make interface remains the canonical implementation.

### Setup

Add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export AGENTIZE_HOME="/path/to/agentize"
source "$AGENTIZE_HOME/scripts/wt-functions.sh"
source "$AGENTIZE_HOME/scripts/agentize-functions.sh"
```

Or use `make env-script` to generate a local `setup.sh` (gitignored) with hardcoded paths:

```bash
make env-script
source setup.sh
```

### Usage

**Initialize a new project:**

```bash
agentize init --name my-project --lang python --path /path/to/project
```

Equivalent to:
```bash
make agentize AGENTIZE_PROJECT_NAME="my-project" \
              AGENTIZE_PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/project" \
              AGENTIZE_PROJECT_LANG="python" \
              AGENTIZE_MODE="init"
```

**Update an existing project:**

From project root or any subdirectory:
```bash
agentize update
```

Or specify explicit path:
```bash
agentize update --path /path/to/project
```

The `update` command finds the nearest `.claude/` directory by traversing parent directories, making it convenient to use from anywhere within your project.

### Requirements

- `AGENTIZE_HOME` environment variable must point to the agentize repository
- `init` requires explicit `--name` and `--lang` flags (no inference)
- `update` searches for nearest `.claude/` directory or accepts `--path` override
- The function prints the resolved project path before executing

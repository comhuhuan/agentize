- To test whole the project, run `make test`
  - To test a specific module, look at all `*.sh` files in the `tests/` folder.
  - To add a new test, create a new `*.sh` file in the `tests/` folder, and append it to `test-all.sh`.
- DO NOT use `cd` anywhere!
  - Use relative paths to this project root only!
  - `cd` permission is disabled for this CLI.
- `README.md` in each folder shall decribe the folder purpose and organization.
  - If not, please create one!
- Keep in mind, all the rules developed in this project should be as project-neutral as possible.
- `docs/draft` folder is for user to draft documents locally, any rules committed to git should avoid mentioning any files in this folder!
- Focus on the rationale of the design itself. DO NOT mention any incremental changes of a history design!
  - **DO NOT**: this design reduces 30% LoC compared to previous design.
  - **DO**: this design simplifies the architecture by providing a unified interface across the modules.

# `wt`: Git worktree helper

## Getting Started

After running `make setup` and sourcing `setup.sh`, the `wt` command is available in your terminal. `wt` is a wrapper around `git worktree` for managing multiple worktrees in a bare repository.

**Installation context:**
- The installer script (`scripts/install`) sets up the bare repository structure automatically
- Manual setup: Clone as bare repo, run `wt init`, then `make setup` in `trees/main`

**Repository context:**
- `wt` commands operate on bare git repositories (not regular clones)
- Worktrees are created under `trees/` directory in the bare repo root
- The installer creates this structure: `<repo>.git/trees/main` where `make setup` generates `setup.sh`

> NOTE: `wt` is implemented in `scripts/wt-cli.sh` which is both executable and sourceable. The `wt` function wrapper is exported via `setup.sh`.

- `wt common`: prints the bare repository path (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`)
- `wt init`
  - If `wt common` is not a bare repo, it dumps an error and exits.
  - This is **mandatory**: 1) run this once per repository, 2) the repository must be a bare git clone (no existing worktrees)
  - It creates `trees/` directory in that repo, and checks out the main/master worktree into `trees/main`
  - If it is already initialized, it should be idempotent, just dump "This repository is already initialized."
  - Uses `WT_DEFAULT_BRANCH` environment variable if set, otherwise defaults to `main` or `master`
- `wt goto <issue-no>|main`: changes directory to the worktree target
  - `wt goto main`: changes to `trees/main`
  - `wt goto <issue-no>`: changes to `trees/issue-<issue-no>` (wildcard pattern `issue-<issue-no>*` used for compatibility)
  - Both `main` and `issue-<issue-no>` should be auto-completable
- `wt spawn <issue-no>`: create a new worktree for the given issue number from the `main` branch
  - Before creating the worktree, it rebases onto the latest default branch from the bare repo
  - `--no-agent`: skip automatic Claude invocation after worktree creation
  - `--yolo`: skip permission prompts by passing `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to Claude
- `wt remove <issue-no>`: remove the worktree for the given issue number
  - `--delete-branch`: delete the branch as well, even if unmerged
  - `-D` / `--force`: legacy aliases for `--delete-branch`
- `wt list`: list all existing worktrees
- `wt prune`: clean up stale worktree metadata (`git worktree prune`)
- `wt purge`
  - It iterates over each worktree starting with `issue-` and checks the corresponding issue on `gh` CLI. If the issue is closed, remove both the worktree and the branch.
  - Each removal should also have the branch removed, and dump a "Branch and worktree of issue-<issue-no> removed." message on stdout.
- `wt help`: show help message

## Bare Repository Requirement

`wt` is designed for **bare git repositories** only. A bare repository is a git repository without a working directory, typically created with `git clone --bare`.

**Why bare repositories?**
- Cleanly separates the repository storage from working directories
- Allows multiple worktrees without conflicts
- Prevents accidental commits to the repository directory itself

**Migration guide:**
If you have an existing non-bare repository, convert it to a bare repository:

```bash
# 1. Clone your existing repo as bare
git clone --bare /path/to/existing/repo /path/to/bare/repo

# 2. Initialize worktree environment
cd /path/to/bare/repo
wt init

# 3. Your main branch is now at trees/main
cd trees/main
```

## Shell Completion (zsh)

The `wt` command provides tab-completion support for zsh users. After running `make setup` and sourcing `setup.sh`, completions are automatically enabled.

**Features:**
- Subcommand completion (`wt <TAB>` shows: common, init, goto, spawn, list, remove, prune, purge, help)
- Flag completion for `spawn` (`--yolo`, `--no-agent`) — flags can appear before or after `<issue-no>`
- Flag completion for `remove` (`--delete-branch`, `-D`, `--force`) — flags can appear before or after `<issue-no>`
- Target completion for `goto` (`main` and `issue-<N>-*` worktrees)

**Setup:**
1. Run `make setup` to generate `setup.sh`
2. Source `setup.sh` in your shell: `source setup.sh`
3. Tab-completion will be available for `wt` commands

**Implementation:** The zsh completion system uses the `wt --complete` helper (see Completion Helper Interface) to dynamically fetch available flags and commands.

**Note:** Completion setup only affects zsh users. Bash users can continue using `wt` without any changes.

## Completion Helper Interface

The `wt` command includes a shell-agnostic completion helper for use by completion systems:

```bash
wt --complete <topic>
```

**Topics:**
- `commands` - List available subcommands (common, init, goto, spawn, list, remove, prune, purge, help)
- `spawn-flags` - List flags for `wt spawn` (--yolo, --no-agent)
- `remove-flags` - List flags for `wt remove` (--delete-branch, -D, --force)
- `goto-targets` - List available targets for `wt goto` (main and issue-<N>-* worktrees)

**Output format:** Newline-delimited tokens, no descriptions.

**Example:**
```bash
$ wt --complete commands
common
init
goto
spawn
list
remove
prune
purge
help

$ wt --complete spawn-flags
--yolo
--no-agent

$ wt --complete goto-targets
main
issue-42
issue-45
```

This helper is used by the zsh completion system and can be used by other shells in the future.

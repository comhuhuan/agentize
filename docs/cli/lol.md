# lol CLI

The `lol` command provides SDK management utilities: upgrade, project management, usage reporting, planning, and automation server capabilities.

## Entrypoints

**Shell (canonical):**
```bash
source setup.sh  # Sources src/cli/lol.sh
lol <command> [options]
```

**Python (optional):**
```bash
python -m agentize.cli <command> [options]
```

The Python entrypoint delegates to shell functions via `bash -c` with `AGENTIZE_HOME` set. Use it for non-sourced environments or scripting contexts where argparse-style parsing is preferred.

## Commands

### lol upgrade

Upgrade the agentize installation.

```bash
lol upgrade
```

The upgrade process has three phases:
1. **Pull updates**: Runs `git pull --rebase` to fetch latest changes
2. **Rebuild environment**: Runs `make setup` to regenerate `setup.sh` with any build process changes
3. **Update Claude plugin** (optional): If `claude` CLI is available, updates the local marketplace and plugin registration. This step is non-fatal; failures do not block the upgrade.

This mirrors the installation process in `scripts/install`, ensuring updates to the build configuration and plugin are applied.

### lol project

Manage GitHub Projects v2 integration.

```bash
lol project --create [--org <owner>] [--title <title>]
lol project --associate <owner>/<id>
lol project --automation [--write <path>]
```

The `--org` flag accepts either an organization or personal user login. When omitted, it defaults to the repository owner (which may be an organization or personal account).

This command shares implementation with `/setup-viewboard` via the shared project library (`src/cli/lol/project-lib.sh`).

See [Project Management](../architecture/project.md) for details.

**See also:** `/setup-viewboard` for self-contained project setup with labels, automation, and Status field verification.

### lol claude-clean

Remove stale project entries from Claude's global configuration file (`~/.claude.json`).

```bash
lol claude-clean [--dry-run]
```

#### Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | No | - | Show what would be removed without modifying the file |

#### Behavior

1. Reads `$HOME/.claude.json` (exits gracefully if missing)
2. Verifies `jq` is available (required dependency)
3. Scans `.projects` keys for non-existent directories
4. Scans `.githubRepoPaths` arrays for non-existent directories
5. If `--dry-run`, prints what would be removed and exits
6. Otherwise, removes stale entries and writes changes atomically

#### Example

```bash
# Preview what would be removed
lol claude-clean --dry-run

# Remove stale entries
lol claude-clean
```

### lol usage

Report Claude Code token usage statistics.

```bash
lol usage [--today | --week]
```

Parses JSONL files from `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` to extract and aggregate token usage statistics by time bucket.

#### Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--today` | No | Yes | Show usage by hour for the last 24 hours |
| `--week` | No | - | Show usage by day for the last 7 days |
| `--cache` | No | - | Include cache token statistics (cache_read, cache_write columns) |
| `--cost` | No | - | Show cost estimate based on model pricing |

#### Example

```bash
# Show today's usage by hour (default)
lol usage

# Show weekly usage by day
lol usage --week
```

### lol plan

Run the multi-agent debate pipeline.

```bash
lol plan [--dry-run] [--verbose] "<feature-description>"
```

Runs the full multi-agent debate pipeline for a feature description, producing a consensus implementation plan. This is the preferred entrypoint for the planner pipeline.

#### Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | No | - | Skip GitHub issue creation; use timestamp-based artifacts |
| `--verbose` | No | - | Print detailed stage logs (quiet by default) |

By default, `lol plan` creates a GitHub issue when `gh` is available. Use `--dry-run` to skip issue creation and use timestamp-based artifact naming instead.

#### Example

```bash
# Run pipeline with default issue creation
lol plan "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Run pipeline without creating a GitHub issue
lol plan --dry-run "Refactor database layer for connection pooling"

# Run pipeline with detailed stage output
lol plan --verbose "Add real-time notifications"
```

See [planner CLI](planner.md) for pipeline stage details and artifact naming.

### lol serve

Long-running server that polls GitHub Projects for "Plan Accepted" issues and automatically invokes `wt spawn` to start implementation.

```bash
lol serve
```

Configure `server.period` and `server.num_workers` in `.agentize.local.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  period: 5m       # Polling interval (format: Nm or Ns)
  num_workers: 5   # Maximum concurrent headless workers (0 = unlimited)
```

Telegram credentials are also loaded from `.agentize.local.yaml`. The server searches for this file in: project root → `$AGENTIZE_HOME` → `$HOME`. If no credentials are configured, the server runs in notification-less mode.

#### Requirements

- Must be run from a bare repository with `wt init` completed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be authenticated
- Project must be associated via `lol project --associate`

#### Behavior

**Implementation Discovery:**
1. Discovers candidate issues using `gh issue list --label agentize:plan --state open`
2. For each candidate, checks project status via per-issue GraphQL lookup
3. Filters issues by:
   - Project Status field = "Plan Accepted" (approval gate)
   - Label = `agentize:plan` (discovery filter)
4. For each matching issue without an existing worktree:
   - Invokes `wt spawn <issue-number>`

**Refinement Discovery:**
1. Discovers refinement candidates with both `agentize:plan` and `agentize:refine` labels
2. Filters issues by:
   - Project Status field = "Proposed"
   - Labels include both `agentize:plan` and `agentize:refine`
3. For each matching issue:
   - Sets status to "Refining" (best-effort claim)
   - Runs `/ultra-planner --refine` headlessly
   - On completion: resets status to "Proposed" and removes `agentize:refine` label

**Polling Loop:**
- Continues polling until interrupted (Ctrl+C)

#### Configuration

Telegram and handsoff settings are loaded from `.agentize.local.yaml`:

```yaml
telegram:
  enabled: true
  token: "your-bot-token"
  chat_id: "your-chat-id"
```

See [Configuration Reference](../envvar.md) for the complete schema.

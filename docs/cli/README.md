## Troubleshooting

### Zsh Tab Completion Not Working

**Problem:** After running `make setup` and `source setup.sh`, tab completion doesn't work for `wt` or other commands.

**Cause:** Stale zsh completion cache from before completion files were moved to `src/completion/`.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete the completion cache
rm -f ~/.zcompdump ~/.zcompdump.zwc

# Restart your zsh session
exec zsh

# Or just re-source setup.sh
source setup.sh
```

After this one-time cleanup, tab completions should work normally.

**Verify it's working:**
```bash
# Check if command is available
which wt

# Try tab completion
wt <TAB>
```

# Planner Pipeline (Internal)

Internal pipeline module used by `lol plan` to run the multi-agent debate workflow via the Python backend. The standalone `planner` command has been removed. The backend uses workflow helpers to keep prompt rendering, ACW invocation, and GitHub publishing consistent across planner and implementation workflows.

## Usage

```bash
lol plan [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--refine <issue-no> [refinement-instructions]] \
  "<feature-description>"
lol plan --refine <issue-no> [refinement-instructions]
```

## Pipeline Stages

`lol plan` runs the full multi-agent debate pipeline for a feature description. Stages 1–4 execute through the Python backend, and Stage 5 runs consensus synthesis via `acw` using the external-consensus prompt template:

1. **Understander** (sonnet) - Gathers codebase context with `Read,Grep,Glob` tools
2. **Bold-proposer** (opus) - Researches SOTA solutions and proposes innovative approaches with `Read,Grep,Glob,WebSearch,WebFetch` tools and `--permission-mode plan`
3. **Critique** (opus) - Validates assumptions and analyzes feasibility (always runs in parallel with Reducer)
4. **Reducer** (opus) - Simplifies proposal following "less is more" philosophy (always runs in parallel with Critique)
5. **Consensus** (opus) - Synthesizes final plan from the three reports using the external-consensus prompt

Critique and reducer append plan-guideline content and always run in parallel via the Python executor; there is no sequential mode.

### `--dry-run` (optional flag)

Skips GitHub issue creation and uses timestamp-based artifact naming. The pipeline still runs fully; only the issue creation/publish step is skipped.

### `--refine <issue-no> [refinement-instructions]`

Refines an existing plan issue by fetching its body from GitHub and rerunning the debate. Optional refinement instructions are appended to the context to steer the agents. The fetched issue body has the trailing provenance footer stripped before reuse as debate context. Refinement runs still write artifacts with `issue-refine-<N>` prefixes and update the existing issue unless `--dry-run` is set. Requires authenticated `gh` access to read the issue body.

### `--verbose` (optional flag)

Prints additional detail lines (such as the artifact prefix and consensus plan path). Stage progress and final artifact locations are always printed.

### Backend Selection (.agentize.local.yaml)

Configure planner backends in `.agentize.local.yaml` using `provider:model` strings:

```yaml
planner:
  backend: claude:opus
  understander: claude:sonnet
  bold: claude:opus
  critique: claude:opus
  reducer: claude:opus
```

Stage-specific keys override `planner.backend`. Defaults remain `claude:sonnet` (understander) and `claude:opus` (others).

`lol plan --backend <provider:model>` forwards an override to the Python backend, replacing `planner.backend` for that run while leaving stage-specific keys untouched.

### Default Issue Creation

By default, `lol plan` creates a placeholder GitHub issue before the pipeline runs using a truncated placeholder title (`[plan] placeholder: <first 50 chars>...`), and uses `issue-{N}` artifact naming. After the consensus stage completes, the issue body is updated with the final plan plus a trailing provenance footer (`Plan based on commit <hash>`), the title is set from the first `Implementation Plan:` or `Consensus Plan:` header in the consensus file (fallback: truncated feature description), and the `agentize:plan` label is applied.

When `--refine` is used, no placeholder issue is created. The issue body is fetched and reused as debate context, and the issue is updated in-place after the consensus stage (unless `--dry-run` is set).

Requires `gh` CLI to be installed and authenticated. If `gh` is unavailable or issue creation fails, logs a warning and falls back to timestamp-based artifact naming.

## Prompt Rendering

Each stage uses `acw` for file-based CLI invocation. Prompts are rendered at runtime by concatenating:
- Agent base prompt (from `.claude-plugin/agents/*.md`)
- Plan-guideline content (from `.claude-plugin/skills/plan-guideline/SKILL.md`, YAML frontmatter stripped)
- Feature description and previous stage output

Prompt templates are rendered via `agentize.workflow.api.prompt.render`, which replaces both `{{TOKEN}}` and `{#TOKEN#}` placeholders without requiring template format changes.

The consensus stage renders a dedicated prompt from `.claude-plugin/skills/external-consensus/external-review-prompt.md` with the three report outputs embedded.

## Artifacts

All intermediate and final artifacts are written to `.tmp/`:

```
.tmp/{timestamp}-understander.txt       # Default (no --issue; Python backend uses output_suffix=\".txt\")
.tmp/{timestamp}-bold.txt
.tmp/{timestamp}-critique.txt
.tmp/{timestamp}-reducer.txt
.tmp/{timestamp}-consensus.md           # Final consensus plan

.tmp/issue-{N}-understander.txt         # When --issue succeeds
.tmp/issue-{N}-bold.txt
.tmp/issue-{N}-critique.txt
.tmp/issue-{N}-reducer.txt
.tmp/issue-{N}-consensus.md             # Final consensus plan (also published to issue)
.tmp/issue-refine-{N}-understander.txt  # Refinement artifacts (issue body context)
.tmp/issue-refine-{N}-bold.txt
.tmp/issue-refine-{N}-critique.txt
.tmp/issue-refine-{N}-reducer.txt
.tmp/issue-refine-{N}-consensus.md      # Refinement consensus (published unless --dry-run)
```

## Relationship to /ultra-planner

The `/ultra-planner` command remains the Claude Code interface for multi-agent planning with automatic issue creation and refinement. `lol plan` provides the same debate pipeline as a shell function for:
- Scripted or automated workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Direct invocation without Claude Code

See `docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md` and `docs/tutorial/01-ultra-planner.md` for the full `/ultra-planner` command documentation.

## Output

Planner progress is printed to stderr as plain text:

- Pipeline start and feature summary
- Stage start lines (including backend labels)
- Pipeline completion and artifact locations
- Issue publish status and URLs (when issue publishing is enabled)

When the default `acw` runner is used, the planner logs the exact `acw` command (per
`docs/cli/acw.md`) before each stage run, followed by the ACW timing logs. After output
validation, the planner logs `<stage> dumped to <output-path>` using the actual `.txt`
or `.md` artifact path. For the consensus stage, the dump log is emitted after the
provenance footer is appended so the path reflects the final output.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Pipeline completed successfully |
| 1 | Missing or invalid arguments |
| 2 | Stage execution failure |

# GitHub Projects v2 Automation

This document describes how to set up automation for GitHub Projects v2 boards after creating or associating a project using `lol project`.

## Overview

The `lol project` command creates or associates a GitHub Projects v2 board with your repository by storing the project metadata in `.agentize.yaml`. Automation setup (automatically adding issues and pull requests to the project) is handled separately through GitHub's native features.

## Automation Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Built-in Auto-add Filters (Recommended)

GitHub Projects v2 provides built-in auto-add workflows that require no code or Actions setup.

**Setup steps:**

1. Open your project board on GitHub
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) in the top right
3. Select **Workflows**
4. Enable **Auto-add to project**
5. Configure filters:
   - **For issues:** `is:issue is:open repo:owner/repo`
   - **For pull requests:** `is:pr is:open repo:owner/repo`

**Advantages:**
- No GitHub Actions required
- No workflow file maintenance
- Works immediately
- No API rate limits

**Limitations:**
- Only supports basic filters
- Cannot run custom logic or set field values

### Method 2: GitHub Actions Workflow (Advanced)

For more control over automation (e.g., setting custom field values, complex filtering), use the `actions/add-to-project` action with GitHub GraphQL API for lifecycle management.

**Setup steps:**

1. Generate the workflow template:
   ```bash
   lol project --automation
   ```

2. Review the output and configure field IDs:
   - Locate `STAGE_FIELD_ID` placeholder in the template
   - See [Configuring Field IDs](#configuring-field-ids) below for lookup instructions

3. Save the configured template to your repository:
   ```bash
   lol project --automation --write .github/workflows/add-to-project.yml
   ```

4. Set up the Personal Access Token (see [Security: Personal Access Token (PAT)](#security-personal-access-token-pat) section below)

5. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/add-to-project.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Projects automation workflow"
   git push
   ```

6. Verify the workflow runs on the **Actions** tab

**Template reference:** See [`templates/github/project-auto-add.yml`](../../templates/github/project-auto-add.yml)

**Automation capabilities:**
- Automatically adds new issues and PRs to the project board
- Sets Stage field to "proposed" for newly opened issues
- Closes linked issues when associated PRs are merged (using GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences`)

**Advantages:**
- Fine-grained control over automation logic
- Automatic lifecycle management (proposed → closed)
- Native PR-to-issue linking via GitHub's closingIssuesReferences
- Supports complex filtering conditions

**Limitations:**
- Requires workflow file maintenance
- Requires manual field/option ID configuration
- Consumes GitHub Actions minutes
- May hit API rate limits on large repos

## Setting Custom Field Values

The generated workflow template automatically sets the Stage field to "proposed" for new issues using the `actions/add-to-project` action's built-in `status-field` and `status-value` parameters.

**For basic customization:**

Edit the generated workflow to change field names or values:
```yaml
- uses: actions/add-to-project@v1.0.2
  with:
    project-url: https://github.com/orgs/${{ env.PROJECT_ORG }}/projects/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
    # Customize the field name and value:
    status-field: Status  # Or "Stage", "Priority", etc.
    status-value: Proposed  # Or "Backlog", "To Do", etc.
```

**For advanced lifecycle automation:**

The template also includes a PR-merge job that closes linked issues when PRs are merged. This uses GitHub CLI's `gh issue close` command, which is simpler than GraphQL mutations and doesn't require option IDs.

See the [`actions/add-to-project` documentation](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project) for all available action parameters.

## Configuring Field IDs

The generated workflow template uses the `actions/add-to-project` action to set the Stage field to "proposed" for new issues. This requires you to look up the Stage field ID for your project.

**Step 1: Get your project's GraphQL ID**

Convert your project number to its GraphQL node ID:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  organization(login: "YOUR_ORG") {
    projectV2(number: YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}'
```

Save the `id` value (e.g., `PVT_xxx`) for the next step.

**Step 2: List all fields**

Query all single-select fields (like Stage/Status):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  node(id: "PVT_xxx") {
    ... on ProjectV2 {
      fields(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
            id
            name
            options {
              id
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

**Step 3: Identify the Stage field ID**

From the query output, locate the `id` of your Stage field (e.g., `PVTSSF_xxx`).

**Step 4: Update the workflow environment variables**

Replace the placeholder values in your workflow file:

```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ORG: YOUR_ORG_HERE
  PROJECT_ID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE
  STAGE_FIELD_ID: PVTSSF_xxx  # From Step 3
```

**Note:** The `STAGE_FIELD_ID` is only used by the `actions/add-to-project` action to set the initial "proposed" status. The workflow no longer requires option IDs since issue closing is handled via `gh issue close` instead of GraphQL field mutations.

Field IDs are stable and don't change unless you delete and recreate the field. You only need to look them up once during initial configuration.

## Security: Personal Access Token (PAT)

If using **Method 2**, the workflow requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with project permissions.

**Create PAT:**

1. Go to `https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new` (or **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Fine-grained tokens** > **Generate new token**)
2. Configure token settings:
   - **Token name:** e.g., "Add to Project Automation"
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (recommended for security)
   - **Repository access:** Select your repository
3. Set permissions:
   - **Permissions:**
     - `project`: **Read and write** (required for adding items to projects)
     - `metadata`: Read-only (automatically granted)
4. Click **Generate token**
5. Copy the token (you won't see it again)

**Add PAT to repository:**

**Option A: Using GitHub CLI (recommended):**
```bash
gh secret set ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT
# Paste your token when prompted
```

**Option B: Using GitHub web interface:**
1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`
4. Value: Paste your token
5. Click **Add secret**

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not triggering

- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` and named with `.yml` extension
- Check the **Actions** tab for error messages
- Ensure the PAT has correct permissions and is not expired

### Items not being added

- Check workflow run logs in the **Actions** tab
- Verify the project URL and organization/project ID are correct
- For Method 1, review the auto-add filter syntax

### Permission errors

- Ensure the PAT has `project` read/write permissions
- Verify the PAT is stored as `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` in repository secrets
- Check that the workflow uses `secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`, not `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`

# Tutorial 01: Plan an Issue

**Read time: 3-5 minutes**

This tutorial explains how to create implementation plans and GitHub issues using the Agentize framework.

## What is `/plan-an-issue`?

`/plan-an-issue` creates GitHub issues tagged with `[plan][tag]` that contain detailed implementation plans. It handles the end-to-end process: creating a plan and generating a GitHub issue from it.

The tags come from `docs/git-msg-tags.md` (see Tutorial 00 for customization).

**Note**: `/make-a-plan` is an intermediate exposure of the planning guideline. You can use `/plan-an-issue` directly for an end-to-end experience that both creates the plan and the GitHub issue.

## Standard Workflow

This is the **recommended (and often mandatory) standard flow**: When you find an implementation to be done, first use `/plan-an-issue` to have it planned.

### Step 1: Describe Your Requirements

Start by describing what you want to implement:

```
User: /plan-an-issue I need to add TypeScript SDK template support to the project
```

### Step 2: AI Creates the Plan

The AI will create a detailed implementation plan including:
- Files to create or modify
- Step-by-step implementation approach
- LOC estimates for each step
- Test strategy
- Architectural considerations

The AI will present the plan for your review. You can:
- Approve it as-is
- Request modifications
- Ask clarifying questions

### Step 3: AI Creates the GitHub Issue

Once you're satisfied with the plan, the AI will:
1. Review tag standards in `docs/git-msg-tags.md`
2. Determine the appropriate tag (e.g., `[plan][feat]`, `[plan][docs]`, `[plan][refactor]`)
3. Draft the issue with proper formatting
4. Confirm with you before creating it on GitHub

## Issue Format

Issues created by `/plan-an-issue` follow this structure:

```markdown
Title: [plan][tag] Brief description

## Problem Statement
Description of what needs to be done and why

## Proposed Solution
[The implementation plan goes here]

## Test Strategy
How the changes will be tested
```

## Tag Selection

The AI automatically selects tags from `docs/git-msg-tags.md`. Common tags include:

- `[plan][feat]`: New features
- `[plan][docs]`: Documentation updates
- `[plan][bugfix]`: Bug fixes
- `[plan][refactor]`: Code refactoring
- `[plan][test]`: Test-only changes
- `[plan][agent.skill]`: New or modified skills
- `[plan][agent.command]`: New or modified commands

If you customized tags in Tutorial 00, those will be available too.

## Scope of `/plan-an-issue`

Use this command as the **standard workflow** for:
- **New features** requiring implementation
- **Refactoring tasks** with multiple file changes
- **Bug fixes** that need a structured approach
- **Improvements** with specific implementation details

For simple one-line fixes or trivial updates, you may skip planning and implement directly.

## Choosing Between `/plan-an-issue` and `/ultra-planner`

**Use `/plan-an-issue`** (single-agent planning) for:
- ✅ **Small to Medium features** (<400 LOC)
- ✅ **Clear requirements** with straightforward implementation path
- ✅ **Time-sensitive planning** (completes in 1-2 minutes)
- ✅ **Standard features** using well-known patterns
- ✅ **Most day-to-day tasks**

**Use `/ultra-planner`** (multi-agent debate) for:
- ✅ **Large to Very Large features** (≥400 LOC)
- ✅ **Complex architectural decisions** requiring multiple perspectives
- ✅ **High-risk features** needing thorough validation
- ✅ **Innovative solutions** where SOTA research adds value
- ✅ **Trade-off analysis** between complexity and simplicity

**When in doubt**: Start with `/plan-an-issue`. If the single-agent plan feels incomplete or you want deeper analysis, escalate to `/ultra-planner` for multi-agent debate-based planning.

See [Tutorial 01b: Ultra Planner](./01b-ultra-planner.md) for details on multi-agent debate-based planning.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through planning a new feature:

**1. User invokes `/plan-an-issue` with requirements:**
```
User: /plan-an-issue I want to add support for Rust projects. The SDK should generate proper Rust project structure with cargo configuration.
```

**2. AI creates a plan:**
```
Agent: I'll create a detailed plan for adding Rust SDK support.
[Creates plan with:
 - New template files to create
 - Makefile modifications
 - Test cases for Rust projects
 - LOC estimates: ~450 LOC total]

Agent: Here's the plan. Does this approach look good?
```

**3. User approves:**
```
User: Yes, looks good
```

**4. AI creates the GitHub issue:**
```
Agent: I'll create a [plan][feat] issue for this implementation.

Title: [plan][feat] Add Rust SDK template support

[Shows draft issue...]

Agent: Should I create this issue on GitHub?

User: Yes

Agent: Issue created: https://github.com/your-repo/issues/45
```

## Using a Plan File Directly

If you have a plan document already:

```
/plan-an-issue docs/draft/my-plan.md
```

The AI will read the plan from that file and create the issue.

## Next Steps

After creating a [plan] issue:
- **Tutorial 02**: Learn how to implement the issue with `/issue-to-impl`, `/code-review`, and `/sync-master`

## Tips

1. **Be specific in requirements**: The more details you provide, the better the plan
2. **Review carefully**: Implementation follows the plan closely
3. **Ask questions**: Clarify anything unclear before approving
4. **Keep plans focused**: One feature or fix per issue works best
5. **Use custom tags**: Add project-specific tags in `docs/git-msg-tags.md` for better organization

# Testing & Dogfeeding Status

This document tracks the testing status of AI rules, skills, and commands in this project. Since these AI rules are subjective and depend on LLM behavior, dogfeeding (using the system to develop itself) provides the most realistic validation.

## Purpose

- Track which skills/commands have been successfully dogfed
- Document real-world usage examples
- Identify issues or improvements discovered through dogfeeding
- Provide confidence in the maturity of each component

## Status Definitions

- ✅ **Validated**: Successfully dogfed with documented examples
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Currently being tested
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Works but has known limitations
- ❌ **Untested**: No dogfeeding validation yet
- 🔧 **Needs Revision**: Issues discovered during dogfeeding

---

## Skills

### fork-dev-branch
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30: Used to create development branch for document-guideline skill
- PR #33: Branch creation worked as expected

**Notes**: Successfully creates standardized branch names from GitHub issues.

---

### plan-an-issue (command)
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30: Created plan issue for document-guideline skill with proper `[plan][agent.skill]` tagging

**Notes**:
- Correctly reads tag standards from `docs/git-msg-tags.md`
- Properly formats issue with Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, and Test Strategy sections
- Integration with GitHub CLI works smoothly

---

### issue-to-impl (command)
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30: Full workflow from issue to implementation
  - Created branch via fork-dev-branch
  - Read implementation plan from issue body
  - Generated documentation and tests
  - Created first milestone

**Notes**:
- Successfully orchestrates the full development workflow
- Integrates fork-dev-branch, milestone, and commit-msg skills
- Handles multi-step implementations correctly

---

### milestone
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30, PR #33:
  - Tracked LOC count accurately during implementation
  - Created milestone documents in `.tmp/milestones/` directory
  - Test status tracking worked correctly
  - Stopped at 800 LOC threshold as expected

**Notes**:
- LOC tracking via `git diff --stat` is reliable
- Milestone document format is clear and useful
- Integration with commit-msg skill works well for milestone commits

---

### commit-msg
**Status**: ✅ Validated (via milestone integration)

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30: Milestone commits created with proper `[milestone][agent.skill]` tags
- Used `--no-verify` flag correctly for milestone commits

**Notes**: Works well when invoked by milestone skill

---

### make-a-plan (now plan-guideline)
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial

**Notes**:
- Renamed to plan-guideline
- Used to create plans but needs more dogfeeding validation
- Should test with various issue types

---

### git-commit (now commit-msg)
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Notes**: Successfully renamed and integrated into workflow

---

### open-pr
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- PR #33: Need to validate if this was created via the command or manually

**Recent Changes**:
- Issue #37: Added remote branch verification step (6.5) to prevent PR creation failures when branch only exists locally
  - Handles three cases: no upstream, local ahead, up-to-date
  - Includes error handling for authentication and diverged branches
  - Needs dogfeeding validation to test the new remote branch push logic

**Notes**: Needs explicit dogfeeding validation, especially for the new remote branch verification feature

---

### miles2miles
**Status**: ❌ Removed

**Notes**:
- Command removed in favor of natural-language resume
- Users now resume with: "Continue from the latest milestone"

---

### open-issue
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial

**Notes**:
- Now named plan-an-issue for `[plan]` issues
- Need to clarify if there's a separate skill for non-plan issues

---

### document-guideline
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #30, PR #33: Created as part of dogfeeding exercise
- Implemented with pre-commit linting guidelines

**Notes**: Successfully added to improve documentation quality

---

### review-standard
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #34: Used to review its own implementation (self-review during dogfeeding)
  - Successfully identified incorrect skill description in SKILL.md frontmatter
  - Validated documentation structure follows project conventions
  - Confirmed folder README.md present and accurate

**What Worked**:
- Systematic two-phase review process (Documentation Quality + Code Quality)
- Clear, actionable feedback with specific file:line references
- Integration with document-guideline standards worked correctly
- Found critical issue that would have gone unnoticed otherwise

**What Didn't Work / Improvements**:
- Manual review process was thorough but time-consuming (command automation will help)
- Phase 2 code quality checks are limited for documentation-only changes (expected)

**Notes**:
- Dogfeeding validated the skill is effective at catching real issues
- Review report format provides clear assessment categories (✅/⚠️/❌)
- Successfully references document-guideline skill and lint-documentation.sh
- Ready for integration with code-review command

### ultra-planner automatic routing
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Implementation Status**:
- Issue #405: Adding automatic complexity-based routing
  - Understander checks lite conditions and outputs `recommended_path: lite | full`
  - Lite conditions: repo-only knowledge, <5 files, <150 LOC
  - Ultra-planner routes based on understander recommendation
  - Planner-lite agent for simple modifications (no consensus step)

**Planned Dogfeeding Tests**:
1. **Lite path test**: Run `/ultra-planner <simple-feature>` and verify:
   - Understander outputs `recommended_path: lite` (all conditions met)
   - Planner-lite agent is invoked (no Bold/Critique/Reducer/Consensus)
   - Total time ~1-2 minutes
2. **Full path test**: Run `/ultra-planner <complex-feature>` and verify:
   - Understander outputs `recommended_path: full` (needs research or exceeds limits)
   - Full debate runs (Bold + Critique + Reducer + Consensus)
   - Total time ~6-12 minutes
3. **Force-full test**: Run `/ultra-planner --force-full <simple-feature>` and verify:
   - Full debate runs despite lite conditions being met
   - Override works correctly

**Notes**: Conservative thresholds (<5 files, <150 LOC) to avoid false negatives

---

### code-review (command)
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Dogfeeding Examples**:
- Issue #34: Manually executed review process on implementation branch
  - Reviewed 3 files (+861 lines)
  - Detected 1 critical issue (incorrect frontmatter description)
  - Validated fix with second review pass

**What Worked**:
- Command interface specification is clear and complete
- Skill integration steps are well-defined
- Error handling covers key edge cases (main branch, no changes, etc.)
- Input/output specification matches review-standard skill expectations

**Notes**:
- Command provides clean interface to invoke review-standard skill
- Ready for end-to-end integration with `/code-review` invocation
- Will enable faster code reviews compared to manual review process

### lol project (command)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Implementation Status**:
- Issue #179: Implementation started with docs and tests
  - Documentation complete (lol.md, metadata.md, project.md, architecture.md)
  - Automation template and guide created (github-projects-automation.md, project-auto-add.yml)
  - Test suite created (test-lol-project.sh) with fixtures for mocked GraphQL
  - Tests currently skip pending implementation of agentize-project.sh

**Planned Features**:
- `lol project --create [--org <org>] [--title <title>]` - Create new GitHub Projects v2 board
- `lol project --associate <org>/<id>` - Associate existing project board
- `lol project --automation [--write <path>]` - Generate automation workflow template

**Notes**:
- Design follows dogfooding-first approach with mocked GraphQL by default
- Tests will validate metadata preservation and proper YAML updates
- Needs implementation of agentize-project.sh and gh-graphql.sh wrappers
- Awaiting milestone 1 completion and implementation loop

---

## Integration Tests

### Full Workflow: Issue → Branch → Implementation → PR
**Status**: ✅ Validated

**Example**: Issue #30 → PR #33
1. ✅ Created plan issue with `/plan-an-issue`
2. ✅ Created branch with `fork-dev-branch` skill (via issue-to-impl)
3. ✅ Implemented with milestone skill tracking
4. ✅ Created milestone commits
5. 🔄 Created PR (need to confirm if via `/open-pr`)

**Success Rate**: 80% (4/5 steps confirmed)

---

## Known Issues & Improvements

### Issue #30 / PR #33 Learnings

**What Worked Well**:
- Branch naming convention is clear and consistent
- Milestone tracking keeps work manageable
- Tag system provides good categorization
- LOC-based pacing prevents overwhelming commits

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Need clearer documentation on when to use milestone vs delivery commits
- Consider adding validation for tag selection
- Test status parsing could be more robust
- Need better error messages when GitHub CLI is not authenticated

**Subjective Elements** (require human judgment):
- Appropriate tag selection (e.g., `[agent.skill]` vs `[feature]`)
- Breaking down work into logical chunks
- Deciding when implementation is "complete"
- Writing clear commit messages

---

## Testing Recommendations

### High Priority (Untested Core Features)
1. **miles2miles**: Resume from milestone - critical for multi-session work
2. **open-pr**: End-to-end PR creation
3. **plan-guideline**: Various issue types and complexity levels

### Medium Priority (Needs More Examples)
1. **fork-dev-branch**: Edge cases (closed issues, invalid issue numbers)
2. **commit-msg**: Direct invocation (not via milestone)
3. **milestone**: Very large implementations (>1600 LOC, multiple milestones)

### Low Priority (Well-Validated)
1. Additional issue-to-impl examples
2. Different repository structures
3. Various test frameworks

---

## Dogfeeding Best Practices

When dogfeeding new skills/commands:

1. **Document the example**: Link to specific issue/PR numbers
2. **Note what worked**: Successful behaviors to preserve
3. **Note what didn't**: Issues to fix or improve
4. **Update this file**: Keep test status current
5. **Capture subjective decisions**: Document where human judgment was needed

---

## Maintenance

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-25 (Updated with open-pr skill remote branch verification - issue #37)

**Update Frequency**: After each dogfeeding session or major change to skills/commands

**Maintainer**: Updated by AI agents and human reviewers during development

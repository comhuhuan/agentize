# Project Management

In `./metadata.md`, we discussed the metadata file `.agentize.yaml` that stores
the GitHub Projects v2 association information:

```yaml
project:
   org: Synthesys-Lab
   id: 3
```

This section discusses how to integrate GitHub Projects v2 with an `agentize`d project.

## Creating or Associating a Project

Create a new GitHub Projects v2 board and associate it with the current repository:
```bash
lol project --create [--org <org>] [--title <title>]
```

Associate an existing GitHub Projects v2 board with the current repository:
```bash
lol project --associate <org>/<id>
```

Both commands update `.agentize.yaml` with `project.org` and `project.id` fields.

## Automation

The `lol project` command provides project association but does not automatically install automation workflows. To automatically add issues and pull requests to your project board, see the [GitHub Projects automation guide](../workflows/github-projects-automation.md).

Generate an automation workflow template:
```bash
lol project --automation [--write <path>]
```

## Project Field Management

Before configuring your Kanban board, you need to create custom fields in GitHub Projects v2 using the GraphQL API.

### Converting Project Number to GraphQL ID

Convert the project number (e.g., `3` from `.agentize.yaml`) to its GraphQL ID:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  organization(login: "Synthesys-Lab") {
    projectV2(number: 3) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}'
```

### Creating Custom Fields

Use the returned GraphQL ID (`PVT_xxx`) to create custom fields:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  createProjectV2Field(
    input: {
      projectId: "PVT_xxx"
      dataType: SINGLE_SELECT
      name: "Stage"
      singleSelectOptions: [
        { name: "proposed" }
        { name: "accepted" }
        { name: "wip" }
        { name: "review" }
        { name: "done" }
        { name: "abandon" }
      ]
    }
  ) {
    projectV2Field {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}'
```

### Querying Issue Project Fields

Look up an issue's project field values (including Stage):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
    issue(number:$number) {
      id
      title
      projectItems(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          id
          project {
            id
            title
            number
          }
          fieldValues(first: 50) {
            nodes {
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
                field { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { name } }
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner='OWNER' -f repo='REPO' -F number=ISSUE_NUMBER
```

This returns all project associations and their field values, allowing you to index issues by their stage.

### Dumping Project Configuration

Automation workflows can dump and version control your project field configuration for reproducibility.

## Kanban Design [^1]

We have two Kanban boards for plans (GitHub Issues) and implementations (Pull Requests).

### Issue Status Field

For issues, we use a `Status` field (Single Selection) to track lifecycle:
- `Proposed`: The issue is proposed but not yet approved.
  - All issues created by AI agents start with this status.
- `Approved`: The issue is approved and ready for implementation.
  - `/issue-to-impl` command requires issues to be `Approved`.
- `WIP`: The issue is being worked on.
  - Prevents multiple workers from working on the same issue.
- `PR Created`: A pull request has been created for the issue.
- `Abandoned`: The issue has been abandoned for one of these reasons:
  - After careful consideration, this addition does not make sense at the issue phase.
  - After implementation, we find it is not a good idea.
- `Dependency`: The issue is blocked by other issues.
- `Done`: The issue has been completed and merged.

We use a `Single Selection` field instead of labels because labels cannot enforce mutual exclusivity.

### Pull Request Status

For pull requests, we use the standard GitHub Projects workflow:
- `Initial Review`: The PR is created and waiting for review.
- `Changes Requested`: Changes are requested on the PR.
- `Dependency`: This PR is blocked for merging because of dependencies on other PRs.
- `Approved`: The PR is approved and ready to be merged.
- `Merged`: The PR has been merged.

[^1]: Kanban is **NOT** a Japanese word! 看 (kan4) means view, and 板 (ban3) means board. So Kanban literally means a "view board".

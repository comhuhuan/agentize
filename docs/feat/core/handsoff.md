# Handsoff Mode

Handsoff mode enables automatic continuation of `/ultra-planner`, `/issue-to-impl`, and `/plan-to-issue` workflows without manual user intervention between Claude Code stops.

## Overview

When handsoff mode is enabled (via `handsoff.enabled: true` in `.agentize.local.yaml`), specific workflows automatically resume after each Claude Code stop until completion or a continuation limit is reached. This allows long-running planning and implementation workflows to proceed autonomously.

**Supported workflows:**
- `/ultra-planner` - Multi-agent debate-based planning (see [ultra-planner.md](ultra-planner.md))
- `/issue-to-impl` - Complete development cycle from issue to PR (see [../tutorial/02-issue-to-impl.md](../tutorial/02-issue-to-impl.md))
- `/plan-to-issue` - Create GitHub [plan] issues from user-provided plans
- `/setup-viewboard` - GitHub Projects v2 board setup (see [../commands/setup-viewboard.md](../commands/setup-viewboard.md))

## How It Works

### Session State Management

When a supported workflow command is invoked, the `UserPromptSubmit` hook creates a session state file:

```
${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json
```

When `AGENTIZE_HOME` is set, session files are stored centrally, enabling cross-worktree visibility. When unset, files fall back to the current working directory (`./.tmp/hooked-sessions/`).

**Initial state structure:**
```json
{
  "workflow": "ultra-planner",
  "state": "initial",
  "continuation_count": 0,
  "issue_no": 42,
  "pr_number": 123
}
```

The `pr_number` field is optional and populated by the `open-pr` skill after a PR is created. When present, the server includes a clickable PR link in completion notifications.

### Issue Index Files

When a workflow is invoked with an issue number (e.g., `/issue-to-impl 42`, `/ultra-planner --refine 42`, or `/ultra-planner --from-issue 42`), the `UserPromptSubmit` hook also creates an issue index file:

```
${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/by-issue/{issue_no}.json
```

**Index file structure:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "<session_id>",
  "workflow": "issue-to-impl"
}
```

This index enables the server to look up which session is handling a given issue, supporting completion notifications when workers finish.

### Auto-Continuation Flow

```
User invokes: /ultra-planner <feature>
       ↓
[UserPromptSubmit Hook]
  - Detects workflow command
  - Creates session state file
  - Initializes continuation_count = 0
       ↓
Claude Code executes workflow
       ↓
Claude Code stops (output limit, token limit, etc.)
       ↓
[Stop Hook]
  - Reads session state file
  - Checks continuation_count < HANDSOFF_MAX_CONTINUATIONS
  - Increments continuation_count
  - Injects workflow-specific auto-continuation prompt
  - Blocks stop with continuation prompt
       ↓
Claude Code automatically resumes with continuation prompt
       ↓
(Repeat until workflow completes or max continuations reached)
```

## Configuration

Configure handsoff mode in `.agentize.local.yaml`:

```yaml
handsoff:
  enabled: true                    # Enable handsoff auto-continuation
  max_continuations: 10            # Maximum auto-continuations per workflow
  auto_permission: true            # Enable Haiku LLM-based auto-permission
  debug: false                     # Enable debug logging
  supervisor:
    provider: claude               # AI provider (none, claude, codex, cursor, opencode)
    model: opus                    # Model for supervisor
    flags: ""                      # Extra flags for acw
```

**YAML search order:**
1. Project root `.agentize.local.yaml`
2. `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.agentize.local.yaml`
3. `$HOME/.agentize.local.yaml` (user-wide, created by installer)

### Settings Reference

| YAML Path | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `handsoff.enabled` | bool | `true` | Enable handsoff auto-continuation |
| `handsoff.max_continuations` | int | `10` | Maximum auto-continuations per workflow |
| `handsoff.auto_permission` | bool | `true` | Enable Haiku LLM-based auto-permission |
| `handsoff.debug` | bool | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `handsoff.supervisor.provider` | string | `none` | AI provider (none, claude, codex, cursor, opencode) |
| `handsoff.supervisor.model` | string | provider-specific | Model for supervisor |
| `handsoff.supervisor.flags` | string | `""` | Extra flags for acw |

**Debug log file:** `${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/permission.txt` (unified permission log)

### Telegram Approval (Optional)

When configured, enables remote approval of tool usage via Telegram. When a PreToolUse decision is `ask`, the hook sends a Telegram message allowing you to approve or deny from your phone.

```yaml
telegram:
  enabled: true
  token: "123456:ABC-DEF..."       # Bot token from @BotFather
  chat_id: "12345678"              # Chat/channel ID
  timeout_sec: 60                  # Approval timeout (max: 7200)
  poll_interval_sec: 5             # Poll interval
  allowed_user_ids: "123,456"      # Allowed user IDs (CSV, optional)
```

**Behavior:**
- When Telegram is enabled and configured, `ask` decisions are sent to Telegram
- Approval messages display inline keyboard buttons (`[✅ Allow]` and `[❌ Deny]`) for one-tap approval
- Button presses provide immediate acknowledgment and update the original message
- On timeout, the original message is edited to show "⏰ Timed Out" status with buttons removed
- On API error, falls back to `ask` (prompts local user)
- Missing configuration logs a warning and falls back to `ask`

## Workflow-Specific Behavior

### `/ultra-planner` Workflow

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive implementation plan and post it to GitHub Issue.

**Auto-continuation prompt (injected by Stop hook):**
```
This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {N}/{MAX} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to create a comprehensive plan and post it on GitHub Issue. Have you delivered this?
1. If not, please continue! Try to be as hands-off as possible, avoid asking user design decision questions, and choose the option you recommend most.
2. If you have already delivered the plan, manually stop further continuations.
3. If you do not know what to do next, or you reached the max continuations limit without delivering the plan,
   look at the current branch name to see what issue you are working on. Then stop manually
   and leave a comment on the GitHub Issue for human collaborators to take over.
```

**Completion criteria:** Plan issue created/updated on GitHub.

### `/issue-to-impl` Workflow

**Goal:** Deliver a PR on GitHub that implements the corresponding issue.

**Plan caching:** During Step 4 (Read Implementation Plan), the workflow caches the extracted "Proposed Solution" section to `.tmp/plan-of-issue-{N}.md`. This cached plan is included in continuation prompts to provide drift awareness and easier resumption during autonomous workflows.

**Auto-continuation prompt (injected by Stop hook):**
```
This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {N}/{MAX} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to deliver a PR on GitHub that implements the corresponding issue. Did you have this delivered?
1. If you have completed a milestone but still have more to do, please continue on the next milestone!
1.5. Review the cached plan (if available):
   - Plan file: {plan_path}
   {plan_excerpt}
2. If you have every coding task done, start the following steps to prepare for PR:
   2.0 Rebase the branch with upstream or origin (priority: upstream/main > upstream/master > origin/main > origin/master).
   2.1 Run the full test suite following the project's test conventions (see CLAUDE.md).
   2.2 Use the code-quality-reviewer agent to review the code quality.
   2.3 If the code review raises concerns, fix the issues and return to 2.1.
   2.4 If the code review is satisfactory, proceed to open the PR.
3. Prepare and create the PR. Do not ask user "Should I create the PR?" - just go ahead and create it!
4. If the PR is successfully created, manually stop further continuations.
```

**Completion criteria:** Pull request created on GitHub with all tests passing.

### `/plan-to-issue` Workflow

**Goal:** Create a GitHub [plan] issue from a user-provided plan.

**Auto-continuation prompt (injected by Stop hook):**
```
This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {N}/{MAX} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to create a GitHub [plan] issue from the user-provided plan.

1. If you have not yet created the GitHub issue, please continue working on it!
   - Parse and format the plan content appropriately
   - Create the issue with proper labels and formatting
   - Use `--body-file` instead of `--body` to avoid flag parsing issues
2. If you have successfully created the GitHub issue, manually stop further continuations.
3. If you are blocked or reached the max continuations limit without creating the issue:
   - Stop manually and inform the user what happened
   - Include what you have done so far
   - Include what is blocking you
   - Include the session ID for human intervention.
```

**Completion criteria:** GitHub [plan] issue successfully created.

### `/setup-viewboard` Workflow

**Goal:** Set up a GitHub Projects v2 board with agentize-compatible configuration.

**Auto-continuation prompt (injected by Stop hook):**
```
This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode, it is currently {N}/{MAX} continuations.
The ultimate goal of this workflow is to set up a GitHub Projects v2 board. Have you completed all steps?
1. If not, please continue with the remaining setup steps!
2. If setup is complete, manually stop further continuations.
```

**Completion criteria:** Project board created with Status field options and labels configured.

**Automatic permissions:** When this workflow is active, the following `gh` CLI commands are automatically allowed:
- `gh auth status` - Authentication verification
- `gh repo view --json owner -q ...` - Repository owner lookup
- `gh api graphql` - Project creation and configuration
- `gh label create --force` - Label creation

These permissions apply **only during the setup-viewboard workflow** and do not affect global permission rules.

## Debugging

### Check Session State

View the current session state file:

```bash
cat ${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json
```

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "workflow": "issue-to-impl",
  "state": "initial",
  "continuation_count": 5,
  "issue_no": 42
}
```

The `issue_no` field is only present when the workflow was invoked with an issue number argument (e.g., `/issue-to-impl 42` or `/ultra-planner --refine 42`).

### View Debug Logs

Enable debug logging by setting `handsoff.debug: true` in `.agentize.local.yaml`, then view logs:

```bash
tail -f ${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hook-debug.log
```

**Example log entries:**
```
[2026-01-07T10:15:23] [abc123] Writing state: {'workflow': 'ultra-planner', 'state': 'initial', 'continuation_count': 0}
[2026-01-07T10:20:45] [abc123] Found existing state file: $AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/abc123.json
[2026-01-07T10:20:45] [abc123] Updating state for continuation: {'workflow': 'ultra-planner', 'state': 'initial', 'continuation_count': 1}
```

### Manual Stop Auto-Continuation

To stop auto-continuation before reaching max limit:

1. Find the session ID from the continuation prompt or logs
2. Edit the session state file:
   ```bash
   # Set continuation_count to max value
   echo '{"workflow": "issue-to-impl", "state": "initial", "continuation_count": 10}' > ${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json
   ```

3. Or delete the session state file entirely:
   ```bash
   rm ${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json
   ```

### Resume Session with Human Intervention

If Claude Code leaves a comment on the issue requesting human intervention:

```bash
# Resume the session by session ID
claude -r {session_id}
```

This allows you to review progress, provide guidance, and manually continue the workflow.

## Hook Implementation

Handsoff mode is implemented via three Claude Code hooks (see [.claude/hooks/README.md](../../.claude/hooks/README.md)):

### `pre-tool-use.py`
- **Event:** `PreToolUse` (before tool execution)
- **Purpose:** Thin wrapper delegating to `.claude-plugin/lib/permission/` module
- **Location:** `.claude-plugin/hooks/pre-tool-use.py`

**Key logic:**
- Imports and calls `lib.permission.determine()` for all permission decisions
- Rules are sourced from `.claude-plugin/lib/permission/rules.py` (canonical location)
- Evaluation order: Global rules → Workflow auto-allow → Haiku LLM → Telegram (single final escalation)
- Returns `allow/deny/ask` decision to Claude Code
- Logs tool usage when `handsoff.debug: true` is set in `.agentize.local.yaml`
- Falls back to `ask` on any import/execution errors

**Architecture notes:**
- The hook is a minimal wrapper (~15 LOC) that delegates to the permission module
- Permission rules are defined in Python code instead of `.claude/settings.json`
- Single source of truth: `.claude-plugin/lib/permission/rules.py`
- Fail-safe behavior: returns `ask` on any errors

See [.claude-plugin/hooks/pre-tool-use.md](../../.claude-plugin/hooks/pre-tool-use.md) for interface details.

### `user-prompt-submit.py` (Claude Code)
- **Event:** `UserPromptSubmit` (before prompt is sent to Claude Code)
- **Purpose:** Initialize session state for supported workflows
- **Location:** `.claude-plugin/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py`

**Key logic:**
- Detects workflow commands: `/ultra-planner`, `/issue-to-impl`, `/plan-to-issue`, `/setup-viewboard`
- Creates `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json` with initial state (falls back to worktree-local `.tmp/` if `AGENTIZE_HOME` is unset)
- Sets `continuation_count = 0`
- When issue number is present, creates issue index file at `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/by-issue/{issue_no}.json`
- Note: `/plan-to-issue` and `/setup-viewboard` do not accept issue number arguments

### `before-prompt-submit.py` (Cursor IDE)
- **Event:** `beforeSubmitPrompt` (before prompt is sent to Cursor)
- **Purpose:** Initialize session state for supported workflows
- **Location:** `.cursor/hooks/before-prompt-submit.py`

**Key logic:**
- Detects workflow commands: `/ultra-planner`, `/issue-to-impl`, `/plan-to-issue`, `/setup-viewboard`
- Creates `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json` with initial state (falls back to worktree-local `.tmp/` if `AGENTIZE_HOME` is unset)
- Sets `continuation_count = 0`
- When issue number is present, creates issue index file at `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/by-issue/{issue_no}.json`

**Note:** The Cursor hook replicates the functionality of the Claude hook, enabling handsoff mode workflows in Cursor IDE. Both hooks use the same session state file format and support the same workflow commands.

### `stop.py`
- **Event:** `Stop` (before Claude Code stops execution)
- **Purpose:** Auto-continue workflow with workflow-specific prompts
- **Location:** `.claude/hooks/stop.py`

**Key logic:**
- Reads session state from `$AGENTIZE_HOME/.tmp/hooked-sessions/{session_id}.json` (falls back to worktree-local `.tmp/` if `AGENTIZE_HOME` is unset)
- Checks `continuation_count < HANDSOFF_MAX_CONTINUATIONS`
- Increments `continuation_count`
- Injects workflow-specific continuation prompt
- Blocks stop and triggers auto-resume

**Source of truth:** Workflow definitions are centralized in `python/agentize/workflow.py`. The hooks import from this module for workflow detection, issue extraction, and continuation prompts.

## Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow to handsoff mode, edit only `python/agentize/workflow.py`:

1. **Add workflow constant** in the `# Workflow name constants` section:
   ```python
   MY_WORKFLOW = 'my-workflow'
   ```

2. **Add command mapping** in `WORKFLOW_COMMANDS`:
   ```python
   WORKFLOW_COMMANDS = {
       ...
       '/my-workflow': MY_WORKFLOW,
   }
   ```

3. **Add continuation prompt** in `_CONTINUATION_PROMPTS`:
   ```python
   _CONTINUATION_PROMPTS = {
       ...
       MY_WORKFLOW: '''
   This is an auto-continuation prompt for handsoff mode...
   ''',
   }
   ```

The hooks will automatically pick up the new workflow—no changes needed to `.claude-plugin/hooks/` or `.cursor/hooks/`.

## Limitations

- **Non-workflow prompts:** Regular Claude Code usage (not `/ultra-planner`, `/issue-to-impl`, `/plan-to-issue`, or `/setup-viewboard`) is unaffected
- **Session isolation:** Each session has independent state; switching sessions resets continuation tracking
- **Max continuations:** Workflows stop after reaching `handsoff.max_continuations` (default: 10)
- **Error recovery:** If Claude Code encounters critical errors, manual intervention may be required
- **No cross-session state:** Session state is not preserved across Claude Code restarts

## Best Practices

1. **Set appropriate limits:** Adjust `handsoff.max_continuations` based on workflow complexity
   - `/ultra-planner`: 5-10 continuations typically sufficient
   - `/issue-to-impl`: 10-20 continuations for complex features

2. **Monitor progress:** Check debug logs or session state periodically for long-running workflows

3. **Human checkpoints:** For critical features, consider manual intervention after key milestones rather than full handsoff mode

4. **Clean up state files:** Periodically clean `${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/` to remove old session states:
   ```bash
   rm ${AGENTIZE_HOME:-.}/.tmp/hooked-sessions/*.json
   ```

5. **Enable debug logging:** Set `handsoff.debug: true` during initial handsoff setup to understand behavior

# Commands

This directory contains command definitions for Claude Code. Commands are shortcuts that can be invoked to execute specific workflows or skills.

## Purpose

Commands provide a simple interface to invoke complex workflows or skills. Each command is defined in a markdown file with frontmatter metadata.

## Organization

- Each command is defined in its own `.md` file
- Command files include:
  - `name`: The command name (used for invocation)
  - `description`: Brief description of what the command does
  - Instructions on how to use the command and which skills it invokes

## Available Commands

- `agent-review.md`: Review code changes via agent with isolated context and Opus model
- `code-review.md`: Review code changes from current HEAD to main/HEAD following review standards
- `git-commit.md`: Invokes the commit-msg skill to create commits with meaningful messages following project standards
- `issue-to-impl.md`: Orchestrates full implementation workflow from issue to completion (creates branch, docs, tests, and first milestone)
- `make-a-plan.md`: Creates comprehensive implementation plans following design-first TDD approach
- `open-issue.md`: Creates GitHub issues from conversation context with proper formatting and tag selection
- `plan-an-issue.md`: Create GitHub [plan] issues from implementation plans with proper formatting
- `pull-request.md`: Review code changes and optionally create a pull request with --open flag
- `refine-issue.md`: Refine GitHub plan issues using multi-agent debate workflow with optional inline refinement instructions
- `sync-master.md`: Synchronizes local main/master branch with upstream (or origin) using rebase
- `ultra-planner.md`: Multi-agent debate-based planning with /ultra-planner command

## Hands-Off Mode

For ultra-planner and issue-to-impl workflows, you can enable hands-off mode to auto-approve safe operations and reduce manual permission prompts.

**Enable:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_HANDSOFF=true
```

**Disable:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_HANDSOFF=false
```

**Auto-Continue Configuration:**

When hands-off mode is enabled, long-running workflows automatically continue after Stop events (e.g., milestone creation) up to a configured limit:

```bash
export HANDSOFF_MAX_CONTINUATIONS=10  # Default: 10 continuations per session
```

This allows multi-milestone implementations to proceed hands-free while preventing infinite loops. Once the limit is reached, manual resume is required.

See individual command docs (ultra-planner.md, issue-to-impl.md) for safety boundaries and troubleshooting, or `docs/handsoff.md` for complete auto-continue documentation.

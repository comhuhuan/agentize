# test_impl_fsm.py

Unit tests for the explicit FSM scaffold introduced in the `impl` workflow.

## Purpose

This test module validates deterministic behavior for the new workflow
orchestration contracts before production kernels are fully migrated.

## Coverage

- `WorkflowContext` helpers for attempts and payload/artifact merge behavior
- Transition table resolution and fail-fast validation behavior
- Orchestrator terminal behavior (`finish` / `fatal`) and log emission format
- Kernel registry scaffold integrity and placeholder safety behavior
- Deterministic parse gate report generation and pass/fail routing contract
- Deterministic review report artifact and threshold gate behavior (via dedicated review tests)
- FSM contracts for explicit PR/rebase event taxonomy and terminal fatal convergence

## Design Rationale

The tests focus on objective control-flow semantics rather than model output
quality, ensuring that state routing behavior remains stable while stage
implementations evolve across future iterations.

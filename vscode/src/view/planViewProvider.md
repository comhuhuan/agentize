# planViewProvider.ts

Webview view provider that renders the Plan Activity Bar panel and routes messages between the
webview UI, session state, and runner.

## External Interface

### PlanViewProvider
- `resolveWebviewView(view: vscode.WebviewView)`: renders HTML, injects initial state,
  and registers the message handler.
- `postState()`: sends a full state replacement to the webview when needed.
- `postSessionUpdate(update: PlanSessionUpdate)`: sends targeted updates for a single session.

### Message Handling
Consumes UI messages:
- `plan/new`
- `plan/run`
- `plan/impl`
- `plan/toggleCollapse`
- `plan/toggleImplCollapse`
- `plan/delete`
- `plan/updateDraft`
- `link/openExternal` - Opens GitHub issue URLs in default browser
- `link/openFile` - Opens local markdown files in VSCode editor

`plan/delete` stops an in-flight session before removing it from storage.
`plan/impl` starts an implementation run for the captured issue number and stores output in a
separate implementation log buffer.

Emits UI messages:
- `state/replace`
- `plan/sessionUpdated`
- `plan/runEvent`

## Internal Helpers

### buildHtml(webview: vscode.Webview)
Builds the webview HTML with CSP, script/style URIs, and initial state injection.

The provider loads the compiled webview script `webview/plan/out/index.js` (built from
`webview/plan/index.ts`) because webviews execute JavaScript only.

The HTML includes a small static skeleton inside `#plan-root` so the view never appears
as a totally blank panel when scripts fail to load or are blocked. The provider also
checks for the presence of compiled webview assets on disk and emits diagnostic output
to the extension OutputChannel when they are missing.

The webview script is loaded via a tiny inline bootloader so the view can surface
`onerror` and other runtime errors in the skeleton status line rather than failing
silently.

The initial state blob escapes `<`, `U+2028`, and `U+2029` to keep the inline bootstrap
script resilient to user-provided content stored in the session state.

### handleRunEvent(event: RunEvent)
Transforms runner events into state updates and UI updates (status changes and log lines).
Plan events update `status` and `logs`; implementation events update `implStatus` and `implLogs`.
Issue numbers are extracted in real time from stdout/stderr lines and persisted on the session.

### resolvePlanCwd()
Resolves the planning working directory.

- If an opened workspace folder contains `trees/main`, uses `<workspace>/trees/main`.
- Otherwise, falls back to the workspace root when it appears to be an Agentize worktree.

### Link Handling

The provider validates and handles link opening requests from the webview:

**`isValidGitHubUrl(url: string): boolean`**
Validates GitHub issue URLs using the pattern `^https://github\.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/issues/\d+$`.

**`openLocalFile(filePath: string): Promise<void>`**
Resolves local file paths relative to the workspace root and opens them in the VSCode editor using `vscode.workspace.openTextDocument()` and `vscode.window.showTextDocument()`.

### Issue Extraction
Plan stdout/stderr lines are scanned for:
- `Created placeholder issue #N`
- `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/N`

When a match is found, `issueNumber` is stored on the session and pushed to the webview.

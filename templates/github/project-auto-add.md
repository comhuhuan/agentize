# GitHub Projects Automation Workflow Template

This document explains how the `project-auto-add.yml` workflow template works and how to configure it for your project.

## Overview

The workflow provides automated issue lifecycle management for GitHub Projects v2:

1. **Auto-add**: Automatically adds new issues and PRs to your project board
2. **Stage "proposed"**: Sets newly opened issues to Stage "proposed"
3. **Auto-done**: Marks linked issues as Stage "done" when PRs are merged

## Workflow Architecture

The template defines two independent jobs:

### Job 1: `add-to-project`

Runs when issues or PRs are opened.

**Trigger**: `issues.opened` or `pull_request.opened`

**For issues**:
- Adds issue to project board
- Sets `Stage` field to `proposed` using the `actions/add-to-project` action's built-in parameters

**For PRs**:
- Adds PR to project board
- Does not set any field values (PRs use separate status workflow)

**Technology**: Uses the `actions/add-to-project@v1.0.2` GitHub Action

### Job 2: `mark-linked-issues-done`

Runs when PRs are closed and merged.

**Trigger**: `pull_request.closed` with `merged == true`

**Process**:
1. **Query linked issues**: Uses `closingIssuesReferences` GraphQL field to find issues that this PR closes
2. **Lookup project items**: For each linked issue, queries its project item ID
3. **Update Stage field**: Uses `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` mutation to set Stage to "done"

**Technology**: Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) and GraphQL API directly

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

You must configure these values in the `env:` section:

```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ORG: YOUR_ORG_HERE              # Your GitHub organization name
  PROJECT_ID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE        # Project number (e.g., 3)
  STAGE_FIELD_ID: YOUR_STAGE_FIELD_ID_HERE           # GraphQL ID of Stage field
  STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID: YOUR_STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID_HERE  # GraphQL ID of "done" option
```

**How to find these values**:

1. **PROJECT_ORG and PROJECT_ID**: These are substituted automatically by `lol project --automation` when you have project metadata in `.agentize.yaml`

2. **STAGE_FIELD_ID and STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID**: You must look these up manually using GraphQL queries (see next section)

### Finding Field and Option IDs

**Step 1: Get your project's GraphQL ID**

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  organization(login: "YOUR_ORG") {
    projectV2(number: YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}'
```

Save the `id` value (looks like `PVT_xxx`).

**Step 2: List all fields and their option IDs**

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  node(id: "PVT_xxx") {
    ... on ProjectV2 {
      fields(first: 20) {
        nodes {
          ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
            id
            name
            options {
              id
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

From the output, find:
- The `id` where `name` is `"Stage"` → This is your `STAGE_FIELD_ID`
- Within that field's options, find the `id` where `name` is `"done"` → This is your `STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID`

### Repository Secret

You must create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and store it as a repository secret:

**Secret name**: `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`

**Required permissions**:
- `project`: Read and write (for adding items and updating fields)
- `metadata`: Read-only (automatically granted)

**Creation**:
```bash
# Create the secret using GitHub CLI
gh secret set ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT
# Paste your PAT when prompted
```

Or use the GitHub web interface: **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**

## How It Works: Technical Details

### Step 1: Add to Project (Issues)

When an issue is opened, the workflow:

1. Checks `github.event_name == 'issues'`
2. Calls `actions/add-to-project` with:
   - `project-url`: Constructed from `PROJECT_ORG` and `PROJECT_ID`
   - `github-token`: Uses the `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` secret
   - `status-field: Stage`: Tells the action to set the Stage field
   - `status-value: proposed`: Sets the value to "proposed"

The action handles all the GraphQL complexity internally.

### Step 2: Add to Project (PRs)

When a PR is opened, the workflow:

1. Checks `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`
2. Calls `actions/add-to-project` with:
   - `project-url`: Constructed from `PROJECT_ORG` and `PROJECT_ID`
   - `github-token`: Uses the `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` secret
   - No `status-field`/`status-value` (PRs don't get initial Stage value)

### Step 3: Mark Linked Issues Done (PR Merge)

When a PR is merged, the workflow executes two bash script steps:

#### 3.1: Get Linked Issues

Queries GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences` field to find issues that this PR closes:

```graphql
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $prNumber: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $prNumber) {
      closingIssuesReferences(first: 10) {
        nodes {
          number
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why this works**: GitHub automatically parses PR body and commits for phrases like "Closes #42" and populates the `closingIssuesReferences` field. This is the same mechanism that auto-closes issues when PRs merge.

The script stores the result in `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` for the next step.

#### 3.2: Update Linked Issues to Done

For each linked issue, the script:

1. **Gets project node ID**: Converts `PROJECT_ORG/PROJECT_ID` to GraphQL node ID
2. **Finds project item ID**: Queries the issue's project items to find the one matching our project
3. **Updates Stage field**: Uses `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` mutation to set Stage to "done"

**GraphQL mutation**:
```graphql
mutation($projectId: ID!, $itemId: ID!, $fieldId: ID!, $valueId: String!) {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(
    input: {
      projectId: $projectId
      itemId: $itemId
      fieldId: $fieldId
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: $valueId }
    }
  ) {
    projectV2Item { id }
  }
}
```

**Error handling**: If an issue is not in the project, the script logs a warning and skips it (no failure).

## Customization

### Changing the Stage Field Name

If your project uses a different field name (e.g., "Status" instead of "Stage"):

1. Update the issue add step:
   ```yaml
   status-field: Status  # Changed from "Stage"
   status-value: proposed
   ```

2. Look up the field ID for "Status" and update `STAGE_FIELD_ID` accordingly

3. The mutation in the PR-merge job will use the correct field ID automatically

### Changing the "Proposed" Value

To set newly opened issues to a different initial value:

```yaml
status-field: Stage
status-value: Backlog  # Changed from "proposed"
```

### Changing the "Done" Value

To mark merged issues as something other than "done":

1. Look up the option ID for your desired value (e.g., "Completed", "Merged")
2. Update `STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID` to that option's ID

### Adding PR Status on Open

To set a Stage value for newly opened PRs:

```yaml
- name: Add PR to project
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/add-to-project@v1.0.2
  with:
    project-url: https://github.com/orgs/${{ env.PROJECT_ORG }}/projects/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
    status-field: Stage
    status-value: In Review  # Add this
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Field not found" errors

**Symptom**: Workflow fails with error about field not found

**Cause**: `STAGE_FIELD_ID` is incorrect or the field was deleted and recreated

**Fix**: Re-run the GraphQL query to get the current field ID

### "Option not found" errors

**Symptom**: Workflow fails when updating to "done"

**Cause**: `STAGE_DONE_OPTION_ID` is incorrect or the option was renamed/deleted

**Fix**: Re-run the GraphQL query to get the current option ID for "done"

### Issues not being marked done

**Symptom**: PR merges but linked issues stay in their current Stage

**Possible causes**:

1. **Issue not in project**: The script skips issues not in the project board. Check if the issue was added to the project.

2. **No "Closes #N" reference**: GitHub's `closingIssuesReferences` requires explicit closing keywords in the PR description or commits. Ensure your PR body includes "Closes #N" or similar.

3. **PAT permissions**: Verify `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` has `project` write permission.

4. **Wrong project**: If the issue is in a different project, update that project's field instead.

### Permission denied errors

**Symptom**: Workflow fails with 403 or permission denied

**Causes**:
- PAT expired
- PAT doesn't have `project` write permission
- PAT's organization access was revoked

**Fix**: Create a new PAT with correct permissions and update the `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` secret

### Rate limiting

**Symptom**: Workflow fails with rate limit errors

**Cause**: Too many GraphQL queries in short time (large batch of merged PRs)

**Mitigation**: GitHub Actions have higher rate limits than user accounts. This is rare but can happen with rapid PR merges.

**Fix**: Wait for rate limit to reset (typically 1 hour) or stagger PR merges

## Limitations

1. **10 linked issues maximum**: The `closingIssuesReferences` query uses `first: 10`. If a PR closes more than 10 issues, only the first 10 will be updated.

2. **Organization projects only**: The template uses `organization(login:)` query. For user projects, modify the GraphQL queries to use `user(login:)` instead.

3. **Single-select fields only**: The mutation uses `singleSelectOptionId`. For other field types (text, number, date), different mutation syntax is required.

4. **No cross-repository support**: Issues must be in the same repository as the PR. Cross-repo closing is not supported by `closingIssuesReferences`.

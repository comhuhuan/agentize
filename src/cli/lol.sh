# lol: AI-powered SDK CLI
# This file is sourced by setup.sh and provides all lol functionality
# Source-first implementation following the wt.sh pattern
#
# Module structure:
#   lol/helpers.sh    - Language detection and utility functions
#   lol/completion.sh - Shell-agnostic completion helper
#   lol/commands.sh   - Thin loader that sources commands/*.sh
#   lol/commands/     - Per-command implementations (_lol_cmd_*)
#   lol/parsers.sh    - Argument parsing for each command
#   lol/dispatch.sh   - Main dispatcher and help text

# Determine script directory for sourcing modules
# Works in both sourced and executed contexts
